            "Can the above linear-time bound be extended to the more general problem of sorting an array? We next show that the answer is “no” for comparison-based sorting algorithms. By a comparison-based sorting algorithm, we mean an algorithm that learns about the elements of the input array A only by comparing them. Non-examples include radix sort, which needs to access the bits of A’s elements, as well as bucket and counting sorts, which need to know the precise values of A’s elements. (These algorithms run in linear time in certain cases, such as when all array elements are small integers.) Examples of comparison-based sorting algorithms include MergeSort, HeapSort, and QuickSort. Such algorithms are useful in practice because they are general-purpose and make no assumptions about what kind of elements you want to sort (e.g., the UNIX qsort function requires only a pointer to the data to be sorted and a function pointer to a user-speciﬁed comparison subroutine). Consider a comparison-based sorting algorithm that always makes at most k comparisons to correctly sort an input array of length n. By the deﬁnition of being comparison-based, the only knowledge the algorithm has about the relative order of the input elements is what can be inferred from the results of its comparisons (and the transitive closure of these results). Using at most k comparisons yields at most 2k distinct comparison results, so the algorithm can infer at most 2k distinct relative orderings. Since the algorithm needs to distinguish the n! diﬀerent possible relative orderings of A’s elements, we have 2k ≥n!. Since n! ≥(n/2)n/2 — or much sharper estimates follow from Stirling’s approximation, if you like — we can take logarithms base 2 to obtain k ≥n\n",
